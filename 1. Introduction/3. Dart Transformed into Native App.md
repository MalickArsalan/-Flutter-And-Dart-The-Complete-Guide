# How is Flutter/Dart Transformed to a Native App

Dart code uses the **Flutter framework** or the **Flutter API(Applications Programming Interface)**. Flutter gives you a collection of **functions of Widgets** which you used in code to build the interface you want to build.

So you have your own widgets, your own code and set of built-in Widgets, and you want to build app for android and iOS. Flutter simply compile that Dart code to **native** code for these different platform. And that happens with the help of .

**Flutter Does NOT use Platform Primitives:**

For example we want to create Flutter app, and we are targeting iOS and Android. Now if we want to add button then in Flutter with this UI as Code approach, we do so by adding '**RaisedButton**'.

Now this is just an instruction in Flutter code which tells Flutter to render a button in that part of your widget tree. On the other hand Flutter has its own implementations because Flutter directly controls every pixel which is drawn.

So flutter does not compile your code into some native equivalence, instead Flutter renders every pixels on its own that gives Flutter a lot of control and a lot of flexibility
