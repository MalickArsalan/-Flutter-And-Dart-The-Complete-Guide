# Overview of Generated Files and Folder

1. **.idea** Folder
Holds some configuration for Android Studio. Because we are not working with Android Studio, so we don't need to change any thing in here.

2. **.vscode** Folder
You might don't have this folder in your project, but if you need to add some  extra configuration for this VS code project, such that, I have set zoom level, so that you can see my code.

3. **android** Folder
It holds complete Android project. When your Flutter cods gets compiled to native code, it will basically get injected into this Android project, and this project will be build into real Android app
So when you build Flutter code, your Android project build inside this folder.

4. **build** Folder
This is very important folder, this holds the output of your Flutter Application. This folder is generated and managed by the Flutter SDK. You should not change any thing in here, that will all be done automatically by flutter SDK when you are developing or when you are building your app for deployment.
